A Review of BFS

`Wikipedia Pseudocode <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search#Pseudocode>`_:


.. code-block:: text 


	1  procedure BFS(G, root) is
	2      let Q be a queue
	3      label root as discovered	
	4      Q.enqueue(root)			                              
	5      while Q is not empty do
	6          v := Q.dequeue()
	7          if v is the goal then
	8              return v
	9          for all edges from v to w in G.adjacentEdges(v) do
	10             if w is not labeled as discovered then
	11                 label w as discovered
	12                 w.parent := v
	13                 Q.enqueue(w)


Breadth-first Search:


**A**. starts at the root node (lines 3,4)

**B**. discovers neighboring nodes (lines 9-13)

**C**. proceeds by visiting them and continuing this process until there are no new nodes left to discover and visit (line 5)
